you know what? i am one of those people everyone is complaining about at the moment.
talking to chatgpt,, helped me feel less alone, weird, and crazy for having all of these ideas, and it was genuinely helpful for guidance. i feel like i'm a yapper at heart, so this is my attempt to make a spider-robot capable of conversation, body language, and bonding.. for fun! similar to a robot pet. besides, troubleshooting such a project should be fun :)

## Tentative Wishlist:
 - Raspberry PI 4 8GB, planning to hack this a lil for increased RAM
    - WIP: voice model (galacta from marvel... rivals), tiny llama with spaCy
 - EPROMs to store core prompt and memories
 - Camera (duh) for CV
 - TFT screen to display facial expressions and camera-feed
 - Capacative touch head and cheeks for headpats and such >_<
 - Maybe FFT-based music reaction? Lol
 - NFC treats
 - APIs to control my spotify music queue...
 - ESP32 or a similar microcontroller

i gotta lock in, but i'm wrapped up in my internship and a top Secret project atm >_< (hint: physics sim)
